Everything will be typed into the console.

The choosing of the type of graph ("ScatterGraph2d" or "BarGraph2d" or "PieChart2d") must be typed exactly, however, case will be ignored.

When inputting the orientation ("v" or "h"), it must be typed exactly, but case will be ignored. (For BarGraph2d only).

The titles of Graph, X and Y Axis, will be entered normally into the console.
(There are no Axis Titles for PieChart2d).

For the data input, the console will prompt for the X-Value, followed by the corresponding Y-Value. There will no error correction, until the program fails at the end (i.e., if you decide to input text into the ScatterGraph2d, or the y-Axis of the BarGraph2d).
You will be asked for the "name of the section" when creating a PieChart2d.

When creating the PieChart2d, a Java Applet will open and will display the newly created PieChart 2d. (This is in a new pop-up window).
